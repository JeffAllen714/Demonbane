## Implementation Priority

I recommend focusing on these systems first, as they form the foundation of your game:

1. **Game State Management** - Controls the flow between menus, exploration, and combat
2. **Basic Combat System** - The core gameplay loop
3. **Character Stats & Progression** - What makes the game rewarding
4. **Simple Procedural Level** - To test the exploration and combat together
5. **Basic UI Systems** - To make testing the game possible
